          <h2>TL;DR</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Use avif as the standard image format (AVIF might be the go-to in the future).</li>
            <li>Lazy load images that are not initially in view.</li>
            <li>Use optimized image components and CDNs.</li>
            <li>If that's not possible, add <code>sizes</code> and <code>srcset</code> to your img tags to let the
              Browser choose.</li>

          <h2>Choose the Right Format</h2>
          <p>There are many image formats to choose from, and modern browsers support quite a few of them.
            The most prominent are PNG, JPG, SVG, avif, and AVIF.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>PNGs (Portable Network Graphics) aren't as portable as the name suggests. They usually have high-quality
              plain graphics, support transparent layers, and offer lossless compression. Graphics and text images are
              quite efficient. However, photographic images are huge compared to other formats.</li>
            <li>JPGs (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is the oldest format on this list, having been published in
              1992. It's also the second most widespread format on the web, after PNGs. Use them when you need to ensure
              compatibility with older browsers, as nearly everything can display JPGs. They offer high-quality images
              but lack transparency and tend to have relatively large file sizes.</li>
            <li>SVGs (Scalable Vector Graphics) are written in HTML-like code and describe how shapes and lines should
              be drawn by the browser. They are ideal for icons and illustrations, as they are animatable, lightweight,
              and can be embedded directly into your HTML. However, they are not suitable for photos.</li>
            <li>WebPs (Web Picture) are the modern successor to JPGs, replacing them as the standard format for the web.
              They compress very effectively, support transparency, and can be animated like GIFs. Yet they could
              degrade highly complex images and don't support progressive encoding (rendering chunks). WebP should be
              your go-to image format.</li>
            <li>AVIFs (AV1 Image File Format) are a very modern format, now supported in all modern browsers. They offer
              even better compression than WebP but require longer decoding times. They also support transparency, wide
              color gamut and are animatable. (In my test runs, I never achieved better compression rates than with
              WebP, but the quality remains higher.)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>There are many more formats; look into them if you like. Maybe someday we'll get JPEG XL as a successor,
            maybe not. Might be worthwhile remembering.
            <br>
            Also, make sure to tailor the sizes of your images to your use case. A 4000x2250 JPEG might look awesome,
            but your hero section is rarely bigger than ~1920x1080.

          <p>You need to re-format and re-size an image? Go googling. Use programs like <a
              href="https://www.xnview.com/en/xnconvert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XnConvert</a>, or
            write a little Node.js script utilizing <a href="https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/" target="_blank"

          <h2>The Best Image Optimization</h2>
          <p>...is to not load the image at all.<br>
            If you know that an image won't be in view when the user first enters your avifage, it's best to let the
            browser load it lazily. Lazy loading allows the browser to prioritize critical tasks, such as rendering
            HTML, applying CSS, running essential JavaScript, and loading more important assets. Once these tasks are
            completed, and as the user scrolls closer to the lazily loaded image (increasing the likelihood of it being
            seen), the browser will fetch and decode the image. A superpower needing 100 lines of code? No, just a
            simple HTML attribute (superpower, same thing): <code>loading='lazy'</code></p>

          <h2>My Grandma Can't See My Picture...</h2>
          <p>You wanted to show your fancy, modern portfolio to your Grandma, but her IE6 messes up everything? Maybe
            your Grandma can only be helped with a <a
              href="https://web.dev/learn/images/prescriptive#the_type_attribute" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer">hack like the one described here</a>. But if you want or need more control over
            what the browser chooses, or want to provide better fallbacks for 'freak image formats' like avif, you can
            make use of the <code>picture</code> element.</p>
          <p>In it, you use an <code>img</code> element just as you normally would. It serves as fallback when no
            specified <code>source</code> matches or if the browser doesn't know how to deal with <code>picture</code>.
            You also add your <code>alt</code> text and attributes like <code>loading</code>, <code>width</code>,
            <code>height</code> and so on.
            Within one or more <code>source</code> elements you define <code>sizes</code> and <code>src</code> or
            <code>srcset</code>. And you
            add a
            condition here.
            That's either the <code>type</code> of your image or a media query in the <code>media</code> attribute. In
            our case we
            define the
            <code>type</code> to be <code>image/avif</code>.
